### Project Title
Bikeshare Project

### Description
Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This will enable people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the exact location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day. I will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC. 

### Files used
