### Project Title
Bikeshare Project

### Description
Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This will enable people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the exact location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day. I will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.
I learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing various descriptive statistics. In this project, I write code to provide the following information
1. Popular times of travel
1. Popular stations and trip
1. Trip duration
1. User info

### Files used
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv
