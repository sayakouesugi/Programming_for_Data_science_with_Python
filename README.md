### Project Title 1
Bikeshare Project

### Description
Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This will enable people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the exact location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day. I will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.
I learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing various descriptive statistics. In this project, I write code to provide the following information
1. Popular times of travel
1. Popular stations and trip
1. Trip duration
1. User info

### Files used
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv

### Credits
This [link Github](http://google.com) was useful for me to complete project

### Project Totle 2
Investigate a Relational Database

### Description
In this project, I will query the Sakila DVD Rental database. The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. For this project, I will be querying the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance. To assist you in queries ahead, the schema for the DVD Rental database is provided [here](https://github.com/sayakouesugi/Programming_for_Data_science_with_Python/blob/master/Investigate_Relational_Database/dvd-rental-erd-2.pdf)
